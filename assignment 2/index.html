    <h2>STOPLIGHT QUOTE </h2>
        <P>Be aware of your own worth, use all of your power to achieve it. Create an ocean from a dewdrop. Do not beg for light from the moon, obtain it from the spark within you</P>
        <P>Life is a struggle and not a matter of privilege. It is nothing but one's knowledge of the temporal and the spiritual world.</P>
        <P>If one cannot live the life of the brave, then it is better to die like the brave.
        </P>
